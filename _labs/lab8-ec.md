# Extra Credit - Lab 8 - Custom Patterns for Secret Scanning

We are just using the out of the box secret scanning settings. Perhaps you are interested in finding other patterns, such as credit card patterns, committed in the code.

This lab covers parts of the following exam domains:

- Domain 2: Configure and use secret scanning
- Domain 6: Describe GitHub Advanced Security best practices

## Exercise

Your assignment here is to implement a secret scanning custom pattern. You can start under the **Settings** --> **Code Security and Analysis** page.

If you are looking for an example of what to search for, we suggest creating a pattern for finding a credit card! Mickey may or may not have accidentally committed customer credit card numbers to the repository and we need to alert on this.

Create a pattern, run a dry-run, and hopefully you find the pattern! If so, save the custom secret scanning pattern to implement.

> [!TIP]
> You can check out [examples for custom patterns for secret scanning](https://github.com/advanced-security/secret-scanning-custom-patterns/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#personally-identifiable-information-pii), including a credit card example (under PII), in the [advanced-security/secret-scanning-custom-patterns](https://github.com/advanced-security/secret-scanning-custom-patterns/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#personally-identifiable-information-pii) repo!

## Summary

In this lab, you should have identified the credit card number that was accidentally committed. Custom secret scanning patterns offer an excellent way to implement additional scanning patterns that are crucial for your organization!
