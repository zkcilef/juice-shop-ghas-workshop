- **Who is this for**: Enterprise - Engineering Leadership, Enterprise - Developers, Open Source Developers or Maintainers, Security Professionals, Startups, Security Leadership, Educators
- **What you'll learn**: Here at GitHub, we like to say that "found means fixed." That's because when issues are found they can more easily be fixed. In this workshop you'll dive into a repository filled with security alerts and begin to remediate them using GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) and Dependabot, effectively maintaining code integrity. You'll also encounter and resolve a few security issues using GitHub Codespaces and GitHub Copilot. The end goal? To learn and develop strategies to motivate your developers to turn reactive fixes into proactive security habits.
